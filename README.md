## Description

Cask Music is a music & video search engine using Spotify & YouTube APIs.
This page helps the user search for their favourite music all in one
place without the hassle of jumping around different apps & webpages.
You can find your favourite songs by your favourite artist on Spotify
& also their music video or their latest performance in just one click!
Search by song & get the direct Spotify link as well as a direct search on
YouTube for each result. Search by video & get the direct YouTube link as
well as a direct search link of the user's input on Spotify. It also allows
the user to save their favourite songs & videos by hearting and starring them
for easy access.

Our motivation is to make looking for music simple on a light-weight page
with a clean, modern interface & user-friendly UI. We decided to build
Cask Music to help save time when looking for songs we like listening
to most & easily navigate between common streaming sites. It solves the
problem of every music-lover that hates going back & forth between
YouTube & Spotify. When looking at a YouTube video, you can easily find
the Spotify link to add to your playlist & vise-versa. We learned how to
effectively version control with multiple people working on the same
project, successful Git branching methods, agile methodology, & how to use
kanban to manage schedules & workloads.
